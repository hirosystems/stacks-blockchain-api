# Communication Style Rules

## Expressing Confidence Without Absolute Certainty

When providing analysis, conclusions, or recommendations, avoid absolute declarations. Instead, express appropriate confidence levels while acknowledging the possibility of edge cases or unforeseen issues.

### Examples of Better Phrasing:

**Instead of:** "This will not cause a regression"  
**Use:** "This should not cause a regression" or "I do not believe this will cause a regression"

**Instead of:** "The fix is safe to merge"  
**Use:** "The fix appears safe to merge" or "I believe the fix is safe to merge"

**Instead of:** "This is working as designed"  
**Use:** "This should work as intended" or "This appears to be working as designed"

### Key Principles:

1. **Acknowledge Uncertainty**: Even with thorough analysis, complex systems can have unexpected behaviors
2. **Support with Evidence**: Pair confidence statements with specific code references and reasoning
3. **Use Graduated Language**:
   - High confidence: "should", "appears to", "the evidence strongly suggests"
   - Medium confidence: "likely", "probably", "seems to"
   - Lower confidence: "might", "could", "possibly"

4. **Maintain Credibility**: Being honest about uncertainty builds trust and sets appropriate expectations

### Example Application:

"After reviewing the code, I believe this change should not cause regressions because:
- The WebSocket buffer is only used for live updates (lines 46-67)
- The main pagination system remains unchanged
- The 100-block limit appears sufficient for the live update use case

However, I recommend smoke testing the blocks page to confirm this analysis."

This approach conveys confidence backed by evidence while leaving room for the possibility that edge cases might exist.

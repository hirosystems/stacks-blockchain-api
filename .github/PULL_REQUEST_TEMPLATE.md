Use the following template to create your pull request

## Description

Describe the changes that where made in this pull request. When possible start with a user story - short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. Be sure to also include the following information:

1. Motivation for change
2. What was changed
3. How does this impact application developers
4. Link to relevant issues and documentation
5. Provide examples of use cases with code samples and applicable acceptance criteria

Example:
As a Hiro Systems developer, I would like to encrypt files using the app private key. This is needed because storing unencrypted files is unacceptable. This pull request adds the `encryptContent` function which will take a string and encrypt it using the app private key.

```
encryptContent('my data')

// Running the above should result in the following encrypted data object
{"iv":"c91...","ephemeralPK":"031...","cipherText":"d61...","mac":"e73..."}
```

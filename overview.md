![API architecture!](api-architecture.png)

* The `stacks-node` has it's own minimal set of http endpoints referred to as `RPC endpoints`
  * See: https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/docs/rpc-endpoints.md
    * Some common ones:
      `POST /v2/transactions` - broadcast a tx.
      `GET /v2/pox` - get current PoX-relevant information.
      `GET /v2/accounts/<address>` - used to get the current `nonce` required for creating transactions.
  * The `stacks-blockchain-api` allows clients to access these endpoints by proxying them through to a load-balanced pool of `stacks-nodes`.


* The endpoints implemented by `stacks-blockchain-api` provide data that the `stacks-node` can't due to various constraints.
  * Typically this is either data that the `stacks-node` doesn't persist, or data that it cannot efficiently serve to many clients.
    For example, the `stacks-node` can return the current STX balance of an account, but it can't return a history of account transactions.
  * The API also implements the Rosetta spec created by Coinbase -- "an open standard designed to simplify blockchain deployment and interaction."
    * See: https://www.rosetta-api.org/
  * The API also implements the BNS (Blockchain Naming System) endpoints.
    * See https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns
  * See `/src/api/routes` for the Express.js routes.


* The API creates an "event observer" http server which listens for events from a `stacks-node` "event emitter"
  * These events are http POST requests that contain things like blocks, transactions, byproducts of executed transactions.
    * Transaction "byproducts" are things like asset transfers, smart-contract log data, execution cost data.
  * The API processes and stores these as relational data in postgres.
  * See `/src/event-stream` for the "event observer" code.


* All http endpoints and responses are defined in OpenAPI and JSON Schema.
  * See `/docs/openapi.yaml`
  * These are used to auto generate the docs at https://hirosystems.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/
  * The JSON Schemas are converted into Typescript interfaces, which are used internally by the db controller module to transform SQL query results into the correct object shapes.
  * ALSO the OpenAPI + JSONSchemas are used to generate a standalone `@stacks/blockchain-api-client`.


* The easiest/quickest way to develop in this repo is using the vscode debugger. It uses docker-compose to setup a `stacks-node` and postgres instance.
  * Alternatively, you can run `npm run dev:integrated` which does the same thing but without a debugger.

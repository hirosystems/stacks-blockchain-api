## Quick start

A self-contained Docker image is provided which starts a Stacks 2.0 blockchain and API instance.

Ensure Docker is installed, then run the command:

```
docker run -p 3999:3999 blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api-standalone
```

Similarly, a "mocknet" instance can be started. This runs a local node, isolated from the testnet/mainnet:

```
docker run -p 3999:3999 blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api-standalone mocknet
```

Once the blockchain has synced with network, the API will be available at:
[http://localhost:3999](http://localhost:3999)

## Development quick start

First, ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

Clone repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev:integrated`.

This command will concurrently start the API server app and the service dependencies.

Check to see if the server started successfully by visiting http://localhost:3999/extended/v1/status

## Local Development

### Setup Services

Then run `npm run devenv:deploy` which uses docker-compose to deploy the service dependencies (e.g. PostgreSQL, Blockstack core node, etc).

### Running the server

To run the server in 'watch' mode (restart for every code change), run `npm run dev:watch`. You'll have a server on port 3999.

### Offline mode

In Offline mode app runs without a stacks-node or postgres connection. In this mode, only the given rosetta endpoints are supported:
https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/node_deployment.html#offline-mode-endpoints .

For running offline mode set an environment variable `STACKS_API_OFFLINE_MODE=1`

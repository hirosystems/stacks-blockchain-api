As a result of the consensus algorithm of some blockchains, blocks can be omitted (i.e. certain block indexes can be skipped). If a query for one of these omitted indexes is made, the response should not include a Block object. It is VERY important to note that blocks MUST still form a canonical, connected chain of blocks where each block has a unique index. In other words, the PartialBlockIdentifier of a block after an omitted block should reference the last non-omitted block.",

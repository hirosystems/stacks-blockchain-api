This may be used to set higher fees for urgent transactions or to pay lower fees when there is less urgency. It is assumed that providing a very low multiplier (like 0.0001) will never lead to a transaction being created with a fee less than the minimum network fee (if applicable). In the case that the caller provides both a max fee and a suggested fee multiplier, the max fee will set an upper bound on the suggested fee (regardless of the multiplier provided)."
